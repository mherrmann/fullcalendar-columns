# fullcalendar-columns
A FullCalendar extension that adds support for multiple columns (/resources) per day. Per-column labels are not supported. Tested with FullCalendar v2.3.1, but likely to be compatible with other versions.

## Live demo

http://jsfiddle.net/jkmda709/2/

## Usage

Include after `fullcalendar.js`:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="fullcalendar.js">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="fullcalendar-columns.js">

In your FullCalendar `options` dictionary, define a view of type `multiColAgenda`. Set `columns` to the array of columns you want displayed (id and name are required):

    $("#calendar").fullCalendar({
        views: {
            multiColAgendaDay: {
                type: 'multiColAgenda',
                duration: { days: 1 },
                columns: [
                    { id: 1, name: 'First Column' },
                    { id: 2, name: 'Second Column' }
                ]
            }
        },
        defaultView: 'multiColAgendaDay'
    });

From then on, each FullCalendar Event Object can have a `column` attribute, which specifies which column of a day the event belongs to and its related columnData with the column object that you passed. For example, using FullCalendar's `events` option:

    events: [{
        title: 'Some event',
        start: moment(), // now
        end: moment().add(1, 'hour'), // in 1 hour
        column: 1,
        columnData: { id: 2, name: 'Second Column' }
    }]

This defines an event in the second column of the current day.

## Advantages
Unlike other similar solutions, this is *not* a fork of FullCalendar. This has the advantage that you can use it with newer versions of FullCalendar, and do not have to depend on a probably unmaintained clone.

## Caveats
The implementation works by tricking FullCalendar into displaying columns as separate days. For example: A Friday with two columns is rendered behind the scenes by asking FullCalendar to draw two days, Friday and the coming Monday, where Monday corresponds to Friday's second column. Care is taken to make this trick transparent to the user (you), but in some cases this is not 100% possible. For example, some [View Object](http://fullcalendar.io/docs/views/View_Object) properties such as `end` do not contain the "correct" value.

This repository captures the state of code which I use in production and currently does not include features which I do not need. However, I am open to feature or pull requests.
